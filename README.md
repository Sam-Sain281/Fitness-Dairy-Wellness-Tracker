About
A web application that allows users to input their workout data which is then listed on the website. This is meant to help track their progress in their workout. I worked on this web app in the 2020 hackRU hackathon with 3 others. I and another team member worked on the front-end with HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript while two other members worked on the backend with SQL and PHP.
